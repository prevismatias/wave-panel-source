# wave source

i decided to leak this source so that the owner will stop using wave to scam

the popularity of wave has blown up thanks to two youtube vids i made and he uses the popularity to lure coustomers

Wave used apis, and was very inconsistant. At least 100-200 people complained and complained. Wave itself was
technically a scam.

the panel source was made in 1-2 weeks and is horrible. It's buggy, unoptimised, and jst plain written horribly.

### HOW TO

1. drag safeguard files into the sg folder
2. setup strings/links in misc.cs
3. a: install packages that are needed 
3. b: deleted the packages folder so smart people are only able to use the source, if you're desperate enough you can fix this source in 10 minutes
