# wave source
## WAVE IS NOT A THING ANYMORE DO NOT GET SCAMMED

i decided to leak this source so that the owner will stop using wave to scam

the popularity of wave has blown up thanks to two youtube vids i made and he uses the popularity to lure coustomers

-----

Wave used apis, and was very inconsistant. At least 100-200 people complained and complained. Wave itself was
technically a scam.

the panel source was made in 1-2 weeks and is horrible. It's buggy, unoptimised, and jst plain written horribly.

### HOW TO

1. drag safeguard files into the sg folder
2. setup strings/links in misc.cs
3. a: install packages that are needed 
(deleted the packages folder so smart people are only able to use the source, if you're desperate enough you can fix this source in 10 minutes)
